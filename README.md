AI-Based Virtual Assistant (Voice Controlled)

A standalone Python command-line voice assistant capable of understanding natural language queries, performing automated tasks, and interacting in real-time using Speech-to-Text, GPT-based NLP, and Text-to-Speech technologies.

📌 Features

🎤 Voice Input using microphone

🧠 Natural Language Understanding powered by GPT

🔊 Text-to-Speech output for voice responses

⚙️ Command-line interface, lightweight and portable

🛠 Extensible architecture for adding custom tasks and intents

🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/voice-assistant.git
cd voice-assistant

2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
conda create -n voice-assistant python=3.10
conda activate voice-assistant

3. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


⚠️ If PyAudio fails to install, you may need OS-specific steps or a wheel file.

🔐 Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the project root:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

▶️ Running the Assistant

Run the main python script:

python assistant.py


You’ll hear:

"Hello! I am your assistant. Say 'exit' to quit."

Then start speaking into your mic.

📦 Example Code Overview
Main Flow

Listen for microphone input

Convert speech → text using STT

Send text to GPT model

Receive understanding/response

Convert text → speech

Speak reply and wait for next command

🧩 How It Works (Step-by-Step)
1. Speech Recognition

Uses microphone via PyAudio

Converts sound waves into audio frames

Sends audio to Google Web Speech API for transcription

2. GPT-Based NLP

The transcribed text is sent to OpenAI's GPT model

The model interprets user intent

Generates a natural-language response

3. Text-to-Speech (TTS)

Response is passed to pyttsx3

Converts text → spoken audio offline

4. Real-Time Interaction

Loop continues until user says "exit"

📝 Requirements File

requirements.txt example:

SpeechRecognition==3.10.0
pyttsx3==2.90
openai==0.28.0
python-dotenv==1.0.0
pyaudio==0.2.13

⚠️ Troubleshooting
PyAudio Installation Error

Windows: install .whl from unofficial wheel repository

macOS: brew install portaudio then pip install pyaudio

Linux: sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev

Microphone Not Detected

Check system input device settings

Ensure permissions are allowed

OpenAI Authentication Error

Make sure .env file is correctly loaded

Regenerate API key if needed

📌 Future Enhancements

Add offline STT (Whisper)

Add task automation (open apps, send emails, etc.)

Add wake-word detection

Add conversation memory

Package as an executable (pyinstaller)
